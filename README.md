# My Personal Portfolio Website
### Showcasing my Web Development Skills and Projects

This portfolio website, belonging to Mohan Ram Majhi, is a dynamic and interactive online presence designed to showcase his skills and information. It features a range of modern web functionalities to enhance user experience.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Loading Screen:** A smooth fade-out effect ensures a pleasant loading experience for users.
* **Dynamic Navigation:** The website includes a mobile-responsive navigation bar with a toggle for smaller screens. It also incorporates a sticky navbar that changes appearance on scroll and offers smooth scrolling to different sections of the page with an offset for fixed headers.
* **Typing Effect:** The hero section features a "typewriter" animation that displays "Hi, I'm Mohan Ram Majhi," providing an engaging introduction.
* **Scroll-Triggered Animations:** Using an Intersection Observer, various content sections (like "About," "CV," "Blog," and "Contact") fade in and slide up as they come into view.
* **Parallax Scroll Effect:** Floating shapes on the page exhibit a subtle parallax effect, moving at different speeds than the scroll, adding visual depth.
* **Enhanced Form Handling:** The contact form includes client-side validation for required fields and email format. Upon submission, it simulates sending with a loading spinner and then attempts to open the user's default email client with a pre-filled `mailto` link. Form inputs also have dynamic styling when focused.
* **Interactive Elements:**
    * Skill tags animate on hover, scaling and rotating slightly.
    * Contact methods also show a subtle lift and scale effect on hover.
    * Buttons feature a ripple effect on click, providing visual feedback.
* **CV Download Functionality:** Users can download a text-based version of Mohan Ram Majhi's CV directly from the website.
* **Scroll-to-Top Button:** A dynamically created button appears when the user scrolls down, allowing for a quick return to the top of the page with a smooth animation.
* **Lazy Loading for Images:** Images are configured to lazy load, improving initial page load performance by only loading image content when it enters the viewport.
* **Theme Toggle:** A dedicated button allows users to switch between light and dark themes, with the preference saved locally in the browser and a subtle animation and notification confirming the change.
* **Notifications System:** A custom notification system provides user feedback for actions like form validation errors, successful CV downloads, and theme changes, appearing prominently and then fading out.

The website is structured with distinct sections for "About Me," "Education," "Skills," and "Contact," providing a comprehensive overview of Mohan Ram Majhi's profile and abilities. The use of Font Awesome icons adds visual flair and functionality across various interactive elements.
